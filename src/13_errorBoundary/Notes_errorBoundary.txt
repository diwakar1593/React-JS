Error Boundary
================
A class component that implements either on or both of the lifecycle methods "getDerivedStateFromError", "componentDidCatch" becomes an error boundary.

"getDerivedStateFromError" method is used to render a fallback UI after an error is thrown.

"componentDidCatch" method is used to log the error information.

Prop Drilling
================
Prop-drilling refers to passing of data from a component to sub components through props.

Context API (React 16 - all developers can use it)
======================================================
1. Context - Create Context
2. Provider - Provides the data to components deep in the hierarchy
3. Consumer - Consumes the data provided by provider directly - complex (In Hooks, consume become very simple)
